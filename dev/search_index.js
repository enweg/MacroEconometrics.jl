Additional meta data, such as warning information during sampling, etc can be put in the metadata field.\n\nBehaviour\n\nMost basic operations will directly be forwarded to the value field. As such, the type can be used like any other array, including multiplication with other arrays, iteration, etc.\n\nFields\n\nvalue::Array{T}: The actual values of the estimated quantity. Should be an Array; If multiple chains have been used, then the chains should be stacked along the last dimension; That is, if only a single chain is being used, then the last dimension should be of length 1. So for a matrix B that is n×n, we would have an array of dimensions n×n×d×c where d are the number of draws, and c is the number of chains.\nmetadata::M: Any additional data that one wishes to save relating to the estimation. This could be warnings from the sampling algorithms, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#MacroEconometrics.Estimated","page":"Home","title":"MacroEconometrics.Estimated","text":"The idea is to abstract he model from the way it has been estimated. In it's most essential form, a model is just a struct, with the same structure no matter how is has been estimated. The only time that estimation matter is when statistics about estimated quantities are asked for. Thus, any statistic that needs to be estimated in a model should be of type Estimated. Estimated itself can then be either Frequentist or Bayesian.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#MacroEconometrics.FixedEstimated","page":"Home","title":"MacroEconometrics.FixedEstimated","text":"\"   Fixing the estimation.\n\nSometimes we want to fix a parameter to a specific value.
